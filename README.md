## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D.

### Overview
This program searches a SQL database of films based on user input, creates a film object based on the query results, and returns the attributes of the object back to the user. The focus of this project is familiarization with SQL in Java and getting used to JDBC, as well as building upon Java concepts and OOP fundamentals.


### Technologies Used
Java
MySQL
Gradle
Spring
JDBC
DAO
Classes
Objects
Interfaces
Exception Handling


### How to Run
In order to run, you must be running a version of Java 1.8 or later
When ran, the program will prompt the user for input based on how they would like to search the database of films
Based on whether the user chooses to search based on the ID number or keyword, the program will request the appropriate search criteria.
Once satisfied with an appropriate response, the program will use the input to search the SQL database, pull data relating to the search, and create a film object based on the result table's columns.
Once finished, the user will be returned to the first menu and prompted to continue their search or quit.
Voila, you're done!


### Lessons Learned

Working with SQL through a Java program was an interesting assignment, and it really helped to strengthen some areas I wasn't sure about and build upon others that needed more clarification. Working with an executed SQL query and figuring out how to properly pull data from it proved to be a challenge at first. I wasn't entirely sure what would be the best way to constitute certain parts of the resultset. Should this be a String? Should this be a date? Reading in dates properly was an area I realized I was unsure about, so taking the time to review the material on it helped. There were multiple questions that arose throughout the project as I progressed. One of my methods ends up calling a constructor with multiple parameters, but another method ends up calling a default constructor and updating each of its attributes individually. Although I did it to practice the different ways to instantiate an object, it made me consider which might be best practice. Another area that I'm still shakey on is the exception handling. I end up throwing the SQLException throughout my code in multiple places without catching the exception. Is it better throw an exception and never catch it or should you handle it as low as you can? Am i limiting an interface by having it throw exceptions in its method signatures? I ended up running into an error with the SQL database having too many queries to it, causing my program to throw a runtime exception. It made me consider whether it was better to have multiple queries throughout your program or just one big query that pulls from multiple tables all at once. Based on the scale of the program and the uncharted territory, it was easy to get lost while working on this program. Multiple times, I would have to step back to make sure I wasn't getting ahead of myself by working on areas before others were completed and working properly. Taking time to brek apart the program requirements helped to keep things relatively on course. Although I still have many questions about Java best practices and how I can apply them to my code, I was happy to resolve an issue where my queries would skip the first result as it printed out the results. It turns out that even if the query you used returns an empty set, ResultSet will not equal null when you assign it. So using .equals(null) on the result set would never be true. In order to properly check if a ResultSet is null, you should call the .next() method on it instead. It will then iterate through the set, starting at the first index available, index 0. The problem is, when you call .next() a second time, it will no longer start at the first index available, and instead start where the cursor was left, which would be index 1. In order to get around this, I used a do-while loop to nest the code following the first use of .next() so that resultset wouldn't have to be reevaluated until it ran at least once, and it would be able to properly pull the first line of the SQL return statement. Although I still have many questions in relation to this project, I learned a lot and I look forward to working on it further in my free time to meet all the stretch goals
