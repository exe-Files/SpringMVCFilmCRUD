## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D.

### Overview
This program presents a web page to a user, allowing them to search through a SQL database of films, and add, edit, or delete a film outputting the result based on the chosen search criteria, and returns the attributes of the film back to the user.\ The focus of this project is getting familiar with Spring MVC and Gradle, as well as building upon concepts from previous projects using SQL, data accessor objects, Model View Controllers, building dynamic webpages, and OOP fundamentals.

### How to Run
In order to run, you must be running a version of Java 1.8 or later.\
When run, the program will prompt the user for input based on how they would like to search the database of films.
Based on whether the user chooses to search based on the ID number or keyword, the program will request the appropriate search criteria.\
Once satisfied with an appropriate response, the program will use the input to search the SQL database, pull data relating to the search, and create a film object based on the result table's columns.\
Once finished, the user will be returned to the first menu and prompted to continue their search or quit.\
Voila, you're done!
